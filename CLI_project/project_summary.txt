in phase 1 we can see the diffrence between raw data and sampled data
where raw data is not normal in nature but sampled data its mean plot is normal

in phase 2 we can see as n increases the normal curve becomes more stable and smooth 
it shows adding more data increases the normality and there is no rule for sample size it even if size is 
small CLT still holds

phase 3 we can see how exactly standard deviation of sample mean and standard error working thier difference
standard error talks about uncertainty and says how much unit data varies if repeated sample is took
and standard deviation is as usual tells about the spread 

phase 4 we can see CLT holds even if the data is heavyly skewed
